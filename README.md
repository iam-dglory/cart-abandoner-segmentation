# Cart Abandoner MECE Segmentation & Retention Strategy

Project Overview
This project implements a Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive (MECE) segmentation system for users who abandoned carts in the last 7 days.  
The goal is to create actionable audience segments that marketers can target for retention campaigns.  
Segments are scored based on conversion potential, profitability, lift, and size, and then reranked to prioritize high-value audiences.
